# AI-MusicGenerationRNN

Automatic Music Generation is a process where a system composes short pieces of music using different parameters like pitch interval, notes,
chords, tempo, etc. In this Project we are going to use Piano Instrument with the following terms:

Note: This is a sound produced by a single key.
Chords: The combination of 2 or more notes is called a chord.
Octave: The distance between two notes is stated as an octave in a piano. It is specifically the gap between the
two notes that share the same letter name.
About this Project :
In this project, we will be creating an Automatic Music Generation model using LSTM. We will fetch notes from all 
music files which will then be fed into the model for prediction. Then finally we will create a MIDI file using these predicted notes.
